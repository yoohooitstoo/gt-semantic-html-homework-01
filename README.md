# Refactoring

## Description 

Coders like to work fast. Sometimes that does not mean efficient or within industry standards. Refactoring allows for the existing code to be updated and meet accessibility requirements. Its really just semantics. Here I have taken a well designed site, with poor semantics, and updated to meet web accessibility standards
